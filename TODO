- Implement RTLD_LAZY, RTLD_SHARED/UNSHARED, RTLD_LAZY_UNDEF, and
  RTLD_MAIN_ONLY (if needed).
- Fix the dladdr test in the testsuite.
- Tie the return code of dlsymtest to whether it was successful or not.
- Make the reimplementation of _dyld_func_lookup actually use its
  parameters.
- Check if we have pragma CALL_ON_LOAD, and find a suitable replacement for
  when it is missing.
- Use the NSModule api (?)
- Use the routine image_for_address (?)
- Use AvailabilityMacros to check for OS X version, and replace deprecated
  functions conditionally based on OS X version.
