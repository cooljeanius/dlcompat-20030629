Thanks to the Fink Project, and to Apple.
Also thanks to the MacPorts project for keeping the distfile for this
project cached, so I could still find it even when the original sources
seemed to have disappeared. (I suppose I could have used the WayBack
Machine on archive.org, but this was easier...)
